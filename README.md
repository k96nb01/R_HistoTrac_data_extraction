# R_HistoTrac_data_extraction
Code to extract and save data from a HistoTrac database for further analysis.

Changes to V2.0:
1. Before you can access the HistoTrac database, you have to set up a connection on your computer to the HistoTrac SQL server. Use the instructions in the powerpoint file "Setting up a connection to a HistoTrac SQL server.pptx" to guide you through setting up this connection on a Windows computer.
2. The R code to extract data from a HistoTrac server has been revised and cleaned up. The error-correcting code now is used to extract data from all tables.

Initial version 1.0:
1. HistoTrac data extraction V1.0.Rmd is the initial version, and provides templates for extracting tables from a HistoTrac database.
